Machine Failure Prediction

This project predicts machine failures using data from various sensors. By analyzing the data, we aim to prevent machine breakdowns before they happen. The project includes data analysis, cleaning, and building machine learning models to make accurate predictions.

What's in the Project:

Dataset: Sensor readings like temperature, air quality, and pressure.
Goal: Predict when machines will fail using smart algorithms.
Key Steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Looked at the data, found patterns, and handled outliers.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for better accuracy.
Model Building: Trained several machine learning models:
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Random Forest
XGBoost (best model with 90.21% accuracy)
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized the models for even better performance.

Results:

Best Model: XGBoost with 90.21% accuracy and 90.43% ROC AUC score.

Future Plans:

Real-time Monitoring: Add live data to predict failures in real-time.
Deploy Model: Use the model in real environments for predictive maintenance.

How to Use:

Clone the repository.
Install the required libraries.
Run the notebook to see the analysis and model building steps.
